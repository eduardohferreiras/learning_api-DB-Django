# learning_api-DB-Django - Exercise 1

## Instructions

Create the prototype to a new social media product. This prototype should be a REST API where we should be able to:

1. Add a new profile;
2. Tag two profiles as connected;
3. Generate a list of new connection suggestions for a certain profile. The more connections a profile has with another profile's connections, the better ranked the suggestion should be;
4. Hide some profiles from the connection suggestions.

For now, use in-process, in-memory storage and don't worry about automated tests.
